# Project-2 Truckin'

This app is designed to have an administrator create new customers and assign them to a certain driver for delivery of their product. The driver can then, check off the customer and return him to the exisiting customer list. 

* We used Sequelize to store and `update` our data. The data from the form is taken and `routed` to `CRUD`.

* Depending on what the user chooses, the data is `rendered` to the corresponding `handlebar` view.

* The Admin is responsible for adding routes and assign them to drivers. Then, the driver must click the button when the delivery is completed.
